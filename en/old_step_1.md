Build a scrolling obstacle game where your character has to reach a finishing point without colliding with obstacles.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Obbys**</span> are a type of platformer game, gaining popularity recently through Roblox, where players have to make it to the end of the level by moving from place to place, avoiding obstacles and other hazzards. </p>

You will:
+ Make a game using code that checks for game **conditions**
+ Create a moving environment using x and y coordinates to `translate` the screen
+ Personalise a game to your interests

Look at these examples and think about how all the obstacles on the screen have been made from shapes.

What happens if you hit an obstacle? How do you win the game?
