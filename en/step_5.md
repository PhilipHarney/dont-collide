**Think** about how you want your sprites to move on screen. 

They can move around randomly, following a pattern, or in relation to the mouse cursor like this example:
<div>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/4d024928ac" width="100%" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
