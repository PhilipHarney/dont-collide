## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade to your project. 

Here are some ideas you could try:
 
### Add a win (or lose) conditon
You can add a condition where players win, or lose, your game. Some ideas might be:
 - An object, such as a finish line, that your players' character needs to touch to win
 - A game ending collion with an object, such as a spaceship hitting an asteroid
 - An amount of time (you can use `frame_count` as a sort of timer) player need to survive

### Include some more objects with effects
As well as having objects that give you points, or end the game, you can add items with other effects. Things like:
 - Making the character bigger, or smaller
 - Making the obstacles move faster, or slower
 - Giving the character extra lives
 - Making the character temporarially invulnerable (making it temporary is the tricky part!)
 
### Make a path for your character to follow
Create a path that players have to keep their character on. The path can be one object, or several different objects. If characters fall off the path, then something happens — they lose points, or the game.

Each example project in the [Introduction](.) has a ‘See Inside’ link for you to open the project and look at the code to get ideas and see how they work.

 **Tip:** Collisions don't have to be bad things. A character running into a power-up, or collecting an item for points, is also a kind of collision.
