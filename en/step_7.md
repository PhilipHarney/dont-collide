## Create behaviour with conditions

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">

In this step you will create some conditions using `if` statements that will affect your game in a way that you choose.

**Think** about how you would like your game to act. What should it do? When will it happen?

You could make your sprites bounce off the edge of the window when they get close, or do something when they touch one another. You could also have your mouse sprite interact with the other sprites, as in the asteroid example.
