## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade to your project. 

Here are some ideas you could try:
 - Victory/defeat condition (and/or score)
 - New pickups/power-ups
 - Race track/safe path
 - Infinite scroll

Each example project in the [Introduction](.) has a ‘See Inside’ link for you to open the project and look at the code to get ideas and see how they work.

Take a look at some Powerful patterns projects created by community members in the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s [Powerful patterns - Community library](https://wke.lt/w/s/KobNfx){:target="_blank"} to see projects created by community members.
