## Introduction

Build a scrolling obstacle game where your character has to reach a finishing point without colliding with obstacles.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Random**</span> means *not having any order or pattern*. Programmers use randomness **all the time**: it shows up in encryption, simulations, data handling and especially in video games! The example project uses randomness to generate both a galaxy of stars **and** a field of asteroids! </p>

You will:
+ Make a game with a goal using code that checks for game **conditions**
+ Create a moving environment using x and y coordinates to `translate` the screen
+ Personalise a game to your interests

### Get inspiration 

You are going to make some design decisions about the kind of game you will make and how you will use code to get the effects you want.

Look at these examples and think about how all the obstacles on the screen have been made from shapes.

What happens if you hit an obstacle? How do you win the game?
