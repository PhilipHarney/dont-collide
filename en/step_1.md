## Introduction

Write python code to make a fun game that uses x,y coordinates to draw geometric shapes which move on the screen.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;"> 
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Random**</span> means *not having any order or pattern*. Programmers use randomness **all the time**: it shows up in encryption, simulations, data handling and especially in video games! The example project uses randomness to generate both a galaxy of stars **and** a field of asteroids! </p>

You will:
+ Use code to create an animation or game
+ Create an environment and populate it with sprites
+ Have something happen when a **condition** is true

You are going to make some design decisions about the kind of game you will make and how you will use code to get the effects you want.

Look at this example and think about how all the shapes on the screen (except the rocketship) have been made from circles, ellipses, squares, rectangles and triangles.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">
